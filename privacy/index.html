    <h1>Privacy Policy for Notesy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 8, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Notesy. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any data that we collect. This privacy policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information through our iOS application.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>Notesy is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or process any personal information. Your notes are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to any external servers.</p>

    <h2>Analytics Data</h2>
    <p>We use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect anonymous usage data that helps us improve the app. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>App usage statistics (such as when the app is opened)</li>
        <li>Basic device information (device model, iOS version)</li>
        <li>Feature usage patterns (like note creation and deletion)</li>
        <li>App performance data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected anonymously and cannot be used to identify individual users.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All notes and user content are stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage. We do not have access to your notes, and they are never uploaded to any external servers.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The only third-party service we use is Google Analytics for Firebase. You can learn more about Google's privacy practices by visiting their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your locally stored data. However, please note that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect personal data, there is no personal information for us to provide, correct, or delete. All your notes and content are under your direct control on your device.</p>
